# Project-Cal
TechSoc'26 task-1. Calculator.

# Instructions!!

This Calculator console application.
This application performs basic arithmetic like
addition, subtration, multiplication and division on TWO 
rational numbers. 
Eg:
>> 3+2
4
>> 4.5^3
91.125
>> 5/4
1.25
>> 4.35 - 5.34
-0.99
(Don't worry about the whitespace!!)

It also does factorial functions.
Eg:
>> 4!
24
>> 6!
720
>> 5!
120

And, it also does basic trignometric functions (sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, csc)
Eg:
>>sin(3)
0.14112
>>cot(2)
-0.457658

You can also write 7 fractions of pi (pi, pi/2, 3pi/2, pi/4, 3pi/4, 5pi/4, 7pi/4) directly in the calculator
>>Sin(pi)
0
>>cos(pi)
-1
>> tan(7pi/4)
-1
>>cot(pi)
NOT DEFINED
1
>>Tan(pi)
0
(It is not case sensitive!!)

To quit write (q or Q)!
